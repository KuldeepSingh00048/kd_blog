                  Turamdih Uranium Mine is a uranium deposit in Jaduguda, Jharkhand. Turamdih mine is a Uranium mine in Jharkhand. It is located 24 km the west of Jaduguda district. This is the fourth uranium mine of The Uranium Corporation of India Ltd. (UCIL). AMD discovered this mine in 1969 and was commissioned in 2003. It lies within the Singhbhum thrust belt and lies up to 170 meters deep from the surface.
                  In 1989, the Uranium Corporation of India undertook the project, however, it was postponed to 1992 and the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr. Anil Kakodkar inaugurated it on November 9, 2002. The total capacity of the mine is 7.6 million tonnes the surface data is explored by an integrated mine planning software
                  The 8 degrees decline entry into the mine facilitates to use of trackless instruments like drill jumbo, passenger carrier, etc. Long home drill equipment is used for regular underground exploration. The production capacity of the ore can be increased from 550 tonnes to 750 tonnes per day by pulling it on the surface through decline
                  In 2003-04's first quarter the fore production has been commenced. For the first 3 years, the ore is shifted to Jaduguda and then it would be again brought back to Turamdih's newly constructed plant.

                 The Jaduguda Mine (also spelt as Jadugoda or Jadugora) is a uranium mine in Jaduguda village 
                 in the Purbi Singhbhum district of the Indian state of Jharkhand. It commenced operation in 1967
                  and was the first uranium mine in India. The deposits at this mine were discovered in 1951.
                 As of March 2012, India possesses eight functional uranium mines, including this Jaduguda Mine. 
                 A new mine, Tummalapalle uranium mine is discovered and mining is going to start from it.
                 Mining activities were suspended in 2014 following an inquiry into the diversion of forest land of
                 the mine. Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) expects mining activity to resume at Jaduguda in 2017.
                 The Jaduguda mine produces up to 25% of the raw materials needed to fuel India's nuclear reactors.

its notification i.e. 11th July 2016. As per the Rule 11 of AMCR 2016, “The mining leases
granted under these rules, shall be granted for a period until the entire reserves of such
minerals in the mine is exhausted: Provided that an existing mining lease as on date of
coming into force of these rules granted to a Government company for extraction of
prescribed substances including uranium or thorium shall be deemed to have been
granted for a period until the entire reserves of such minerals in the mine is exhausted”.
According to the above rule, the mining lease of Narwapahar mine has been extended
for a period until the entire reserves is exhausted. The project had received

                  Hindalco’s commitment towards sustainable mining development efforts, the company has retrieved five hectares of land in its bauxite mine in Bagru Hills in Lohardaga, Jharkhand and has built a biodiversity park. The park accommodates a butterfly garden and has seasonal fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants, herbs, tea and flowers.

                  Aditya Birla Group subsidiary Hindalco’s Bagru Hills bauxite mine is located approximately 76km from Ranchi stands as one of the oldest bauxite mines in India, whose exploitation commenced in 1993. The mine delivers as much as 3.5 lakh tonnes of bauxite annually for Hindalco’s alumina refinery in Muri.

                  Sushant Guru, Head of Hindalco’s sustainable mining development wing said: “In March 2019, a plan was drawn up to reclaim nearly 5 Ha (12.35 acres) land in Bagru Hills for this pilot project. One of the key features for reclaiming the land was to preserve the topsoil of the land and store it away carefully.”

                 “Once mining from a patch of land is complete, the topsoil is put back after backfilling of the overburden A symbiotic fungus named VAM, which has been developed by Hindalco in association with the Coimbatore-based Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding, is used to curate the topsoil to nurse its health and fertility back. In Bagru, a little over Rs 1 crore was gone into this project.”

                  Speaking at a press conference after commissioning UCIL’s Bagjata mines around 50km from Jamshedpur today, Anil Kakodkar, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India, said the new uranium mines would make India self-sufficient.

                  The new underground mines would have a capacity of 500 tonne per day.

                  When asked about this move, Kakodkar said: “We don’t want to take chances keeping in mind our earlier experiences. The new mines would ensure uninterrupted supply of uranium for our upcoming nuclear power plants in the country.”

                  Kakodkar said there are 17 nuclear plants in the country, which are facing a shortage of uranium. Most of these plants are operating on 50 per cent of the plant load factor.

                  Besides increasing uranium production, the country would import uranium from other countries for feeding nuclear power plants.

                  Agreeing that the uranium produced in country is dearer than what is available, Kakodkar added: “The price of uranium in the international market would keep fluctuating according to the demand, which is set to rise in the coming years. We have no other choice but to become self-sufficient.”

                  At present, the UCIL is operating four mines in East Singhbhum, Jadugoda, Turamdih, Narwapahar and Bhatin. It took them three years to commission the Bagjata mines at an investment of Rs 97 crore. The mine, with an ore reserve of 4.21 million tonne is expected to last 23 years.
